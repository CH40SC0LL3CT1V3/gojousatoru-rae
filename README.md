~~Shadow doubles DNI if our Shadow is fronting (friends are fine, system fictives are fine, if he interacts first, and crowns are fine)~~ ‼️‼️ **DOUBLES DO NOT EXIST. THAT'S A FALSE NARRATIVE IN PONY TOWN.**

Important things to look out for right now:

Busy = Default or semi-verbal

Away = Afk or nonverbal in both text and voice

(using only emojis or whisper to communicate)

Looking for rp = Looking for one or is already in one

Looking for chat = Probably lonely, most likely is not nonverbal at the time but can change at any moment

Online = Nonverbal (Some skins will have [NV] in the names, which means nonverbal and won’t change until the skin is switched for our needs.)

DNTUF (do not touch unless friends) for right now, not because we have TD, but we just find it annoying when strangers walk up and boop us for no reason and such. Don't feel offended if we tell you to stop, unless you do such on purpose then we'll just ignore you and laugh, because it's clearly pathetic to try and piss someone off like that lmao.

DNI tcest, proshitters, etc. basic dni criteria, if you think endosystems are valid/undiagnosed systems are invalid, white cishet men, BNHA / MHA shippers and fans, toxic genshin impact fans, and ages below 16 and 25+, calling others' interests cringe and too babyish, dsmp fans and stans (current friends okay along with c!/cc!Ranboo, just FYI our Wilbur separated from his source so DO NOT ASSOCIATE HIM WITH WILBUR SOOT), disrespect neopronouns/neogenders unless they're actually invalid (ex: s#icidegender, things along that line), Bean. (Sonic area, they know who)

IRLs, DNI please. Just, please. /lh

We are fine with ships, BUT CERTAIN SHIP DNIS ARE:

Shadails, Shadamy, Shadaria, Sonails, Sonamy, TailsAmy, Tails x Cream, Sonilver, Shadilver, Sonouge, you get the idea. Basically proship, which also includes!! GoYuu, shit like that!! GO AWAY!! (Also certain Sukugo shippers who ship Yujikuna or Meguna, please.. those vessels are minors, also give Heian Sukuna some respect, damn 🙁🙁)

Other ships are fine such as Sonadow (I guess), Knuxouge /p and not romantic, sukuggoonfnkhtfh oh my god sukugo fans int and stsg fans too.. just please be careful if stsg because I'm still trying to recover from source memories 🙁 -🩵

Lovely friends we're often with:

Needle (I love you [/p] you silly goof of a sibling)

Sunky (You're the goobiest brother!!)
